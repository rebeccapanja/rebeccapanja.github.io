### Highlights and notes

> The ancient philosophy of Cynicism focused on cultivating virtue and strength of character through rigorous training that consisted of enduring various forms of voluntary hardship. It was an austere and self-disciplined way of life. Zeno’s followers would later call it a shortcut to virtue.

> Marcus learned the same attitude from his Stoic teachers. He repeatedly warned himself not to become distracted by reading too many books—thus wasting time on trifling issues in logic and metaphysics—but instead to remain focused on the practical goal of living wisely.

> Zeno told his students that he had come to value wisdom more than wealth or reputation. He used to say, My most profitable journey began on the day I was shipwrecked and lost my entire fortune.

> For Stoics, virtue is still the only true good—the Cynics were right about that—but it’s also natural to prefer health to sickness, wealth to poverty, friends to enemies, and so on, within reasonable bounds. External advantages such as wealth may create more opportunities but in themselves they simply don’t have the kind of value that can ever define a good life.

> The teachings of Zeno and Cleanthes were simple, practical, and concise. True to his Cynic roots, Zeno focused on improving the character of his young students while avoiding long-winded academic debates

> Marcus Aurelius was still talking about dyeing things purple. He warns himself to avoid dyeing his character with the royal purple and turning into a Caesar, instead aspiring to remain true to his philosophical principles. He (twice) reminds himself that his purple imperial robes are mere sheep’s wool dyed in fermented shellfish mucus. He tells himself to dye his mind with the wisdom of philosophical precepts handed down from his Stoic teachers. Marcus Aurelius, indeed, viewed himself as a Stoic first and an emperor second.

> Humans excel when they think clearly and reason well about their lives, which amounts to living wisely.

> xternal things do have some value, but they’re not worth getting upset over—it’s a different kind of value. One way Stoics explained this was by saying that if we could put virtue on one side of a set of scales, it wouldn’t matter how many gold coins or other indifferent things piled up on the opposing side—it should never tip the balance. Nevertheless, some external things are preferable to others, and wisdom consists precisely in our ability to make these sorts of value judgments. Life is preferable to death, wealth is preferable to poverty, health is preferable to sickness, friends are preferable to enemies, and so on.

> As Socrates had put it earlier, such external advantages in life are good only if we use them wisely.

> The Stoics would say that things like health, wealth, and reputation are, at most, advantages or opportunities rather than being good in themselves.

> The Stoic Sage, or wise man, needs nothing but uses everything well; the fool believes himself to need countless things, but he uses them all badly.

> In addition to believing that humans are essentially thinking creatures capable of reason, the Stoics also believed that human nature is inherently social

> Stoic ethics involves cultivating this natural affection toward other people in accord with virtues like justice, fairness, and kindness. Although this social dimension of Stoicism is often overlooked today, it’s one of the main themes of The Meditations

> Another popular misconception today is that Stoics are unemotional. The ancient Stoics themselves consistently denied this, saying that their ideal was not to be like a man of iron or to have a heart of stone. In fact, they distinguished between three types of emotion: good, bad, and indifferent.

> They also believed that we have many irrational desires and emotions, like fear, anger, craving, and certain forms of pleasure that are bad for us. Stoics did not believe that unhealthy emotions should be suppressed; rather, they should be replaced by healthy ones. However, these healthy emotions aren’t entirely under our control, and we’re not always guaranteed to experience them, so we shouldn’t confuse them with virtue, the goal of life. For Stoics, they’re like an added bonus.

> They also taught that our initial automatic feelings are to be viewed as natural and indifferent. These include things like being startled or irritated, blushing, turning pale, tensing up, shaking, sweating, or stammering. They are natural reflex reactions, our first reactions before we escalate them into full-blown passions

> Stoics view them with indifference, as neither good nor bad

> What matters is what he does next. He exhibits courage and self-control precisely by accepting these feelings, rising above them, and asserting his capacity for reason

> Everything comes back to the exercise of reason and the goal of living wisely

> much confusion is caused by people mixing up Stoicism (capital S) with stoicism (lowercase s). Lowercase stoicism is just a personality trait: it’s mental toughness or the ability to endure pain and adversity without complaining. Uppercase Stoicism is a whole school of Greek philosophy. Being emotionally tough or resilient is just one small part of that philosophy, and lowercase stoicism neglects the entire social dimension of Stoic virtue, which has to do with justice, fairness, and kindness to others. Also, when people talk about being stoic or having a stiff upper lip, they often mean just suppressing their feelings, which is actually known to be quite unhealthy. So it’s important to be very clear that’s not what Marcus Aurelius and other Stoics recommended. Stoic philosophy teaches us instead to transform unhealthy emotions into healthy ones. We do so by using reason to challenge the value judgments and other beliefs on which they’re based, much as we do in modern rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

> The appearance of wisdom therefore became more important to many Romans than wisdom itself

> Epictetus, in typical Stoic fashion, continually warned his students not to confuse academic learning with wisdom and to avoid petty arguments, hairsplitting, or wasting time on abstract, academic topics. He emphasized the fundamental difference between a Sophist and a Stoic: the former speaks to win praise from his audience, the latter to improve them by helping them to achieve wisdom and virtue

> Rhetoricians thrive on praise, which is vanity; philosophers love truth and embrace humility. Rhetoric is a form of entertainment, pleasant to hear; philosophy is a moral and psychological therapy, often painful to hear because it forces us to admit our own faults in order to remedy them—sometimes the truth hurts

> Marcus revealed his distaste for the pretense and corruption of court life in The Meditations. He promised himself, though, that he would never again waste his time dwelling negatively on it

> He reminded himself that wherever it is possible to live, it is possible to live well, to live wisely, even at Rome, where he clearly felt it was a struggle to stay in tune with Stoic virtue.

> He found the insincerity of life at court a constant frustration, and he came to rely on Stoicism as a way of coping.5

> Marcus began to build on these values by training in philosophy from an exceptionally young age.

> he seems to have learned about philosophy first as a practical way of life when he was still a young boy living in his mother’s house, long before he began studying philosophical theory under several eminent tutors. He first taught himself to endure physical discomfort and overcome

> unhealthy habits. He learned to tolerate other people’s criticisms and to avoid being easily swayed by fine words or flattery.

> Mastering our passions in this way is the first stage of training in Stoicism. Epictetus called it the Discipline of Desire, although it encompasses both our desires and our fears or aversions.

> Marcus was now second in line to the throne and destined to succeed Antoninus. He was introduced to the circle of intellectuals at court, some of the finest rhetoricians and philosophers in the empire.

> Antoninus was such a man, according to Marcus. The traits he’s described as possessing paint a vivid picture of the sort of character that Marcus wanted to develop through his training in Stoic philosophy. Once Antoninus had considered something and arrived at a decision, for example, he implemented it with unwavering determination.

> The seeds of that transformation were planted by his family, perhaps especially by his mother, but they were then nurtured by a series of exceptional tutors.

> tudying rhetoric in order to communicate more eloquently and persuasively would become Marcus’s main obligation as a student, although it clashed with his growing interest in Stoic philosophy. Herodes Atticus and others trained him extensively in Greek, the language he would use to write The Meditations.

> Fronto’s job was to imbue the boy with the cultural sophistication befitting his station in life and train him to become an effective political speechwriter and orator. This was a very difficult time for the young Caesar, as he felt torn between rhetoric and philosophy. Yet Fronto’s influence gradually waned. Eloquence is one thing, wisdom another. We’re told that Plato’s saying was always on Marcus’s lips: those states prospered where the philosophers were kings or the kings philosophers.

> Stoic theory of emotions

> First come the initial impressions (phantasiai) that are imposed involuntarily on our minds from outside, when we’re initially exposed to an event such as the storm at sea

> In the second stage of our response, the Stoics say, we typically add voluntary judgments of assent (sunkatatheseis) to these automatic impressions. Here the Stoic wise man’s response differs from that of the majority of people

> Initial impressions automatically impose themselves on your mind, including thoughts and emerging feelings called propatheiai, or proto-passions, by the Stoics. For example, the impression The boat is sinking would quite naturally evoke some initial anxiety.

> Stoics, like the unnamed philosopher in the story, have learned to take a step back from their initial thoughts and feelings and withhold their assent from them

> Responding calmly and with courage is more important. That’s what you’d praise other people for doing if faced with the same situation.

> On the other hand, if you have assented to the impression that something is intrinsically bad or catastrophic, then a full-blown passion develops, which can quickly spiral out of control

> The Stoic likewise tells himself that although the situation may appear frightening, the truly important thing in life is how he chooses to respond. So he reminds himself to view the storm with Stoic indifference and to respond with wisdom and courage while accepting his initial nervous reaction as harmless and inevitable. What he does not do, though, is make things worse for himself by continuing to worry.

> Marcus was grateful that when he first began to dabble in philosophy he didn’t completely fall under the spell of a Sophist, like Fronto, or end up obsessively poring over books, working out logical puzzles, or speculating about physics and cosmology. Rather, he focused on Stoic ethics and its practical application in daily life.

> Marcus went through a sort of conversion from rhetoric to philosophy, and this appears to have been a pivotal event in his life

> Marcus grew up at time when rhetoric was highly fashionable, particularly at the imperial court of Hadrian.

> However, from his early youth, Marcus had earned a reputation for speaking plainly and honestly

> Marcus tells himself that true philosophy is both simple and modest, and we should never be seduced into vanity or ostentation in this regard. Always take the shortest route, he says.22 The short way is the way of Nature, which leads to the soundest words and actions.

> For Stoics, this honesty and simplicity of language requires two main things: conciseness and objectivity. It would be an oversimplification to say that this just means to stop complaining, but in many cases the Stoics did advise along those lines. The point at which our language starts evoking strong emotions is precisely when we start saying things that involve strong value judgments, whether to others or ourselves. According to Stoic philosophy, when we assign intrinsic values like good or bad to external events, we’re behaving irrationally and even exhibiting a form of self-deception. When we call something a catastrophe, for instance, we go beyond the bare facts and start distorting events and deceiving ourselves.

> Stoic rhetoric identified five virtues of speech:

1. Correct grammar and good vocabulary
2. Clarity of expression, making the ideas easily understood
3. Conciseness, employing no more words than necessary
4. Appropriateness of style, suited to the subject matter and apparently also to the audience
5. Distinction, or artistic excellence, and the avoidance of vulgarity
Traditional rhetoric shared most of these values, with the notable exception of conciseness.

> the Stoic use of language was normally seen as being completely at odds with established forms of rhetoric.
> The Sophists, as we’ve seen, sought to persuade others by appealing to their emotions, typically in order to win praise. The Stoics, by contrast, placed supreme value on grasping and communicating the truth by appealing to reason. This meant avoiding the use of emotive rhetoric or strong value judgments. We usually think of rhetoric as something used to manipulate other people. We tend to forget we’re doing it to ourselves as well, not only when we speak but also when we use language to think.

We forget that the language we use influences our thinking too.

> The Stoics were certainly interested in how our words affect others. However, their priority was to change the way we affect ourselves, our own thoughts and feelings, through our choice of language. We exaggerate, overgeneralize, omit information, and use strong language and colorful metaphors

> People tend to think that exclamations like these are a natural consequence of strong emotions like anger. But what if they’re also causing or perpetuating our emotions? If you think about it, rhetoric like this is designed to evoke strong feelings. By contrast, undoing the effects of emotional rhetoric by describing the same events more objectively forms the basis of the ancient Stoic therapy of the passions.

> The way we talk and think about events involves making value judgments, which shape our feelings.

> There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so

> If you stick with the facts and don’t unnecessarily extrapolate from them, you will put paid to many anxieties in life.

> objective representation

> As an aspiring Stoic, you should begin by practicing deliberately describing events more objectively and in less emotional terms.

> Sticking to the facts can, by itself, often reduce your anxiety. Cognitive therapists use the neologism catastrophizing, or dwelling on the worst-case scenario, to help explain to clients how we project our values onto external events.

> Modern cognitive therapists advise their clients to describe events in more down-to-earth language, like the Stoics before them. They call it decatastrophizing

> Another common method of decatastrophizing is for cognitive therapists to ask clients repeatedly, What next? Mental images of feared events often rapidly escalate to the worst, most anxiety-provoking part and then remain glued there as if the upsetting experience were somehow timeless. In reality, though, everything has a before, during, and after phase.

> Reminding himself of the transience of events is one of Marcus’s favorite strategies, as we’ll see in later chapters. One way of doing that is to ask yourself, What, realistically, will most likely happen next? And then what? And then what? And so on

> transactional model of stress

> Imagine a seesaw, with your appraisal of the severity of a situation—how threatening or dangerous it is—on one side. On the other side is your appraisal of your own ability to cope, your self-confidence if you like. If you believe that the threat outweighs your ability to cope and the seesaw tips toward danger, then you’ll probably feel extremely stressed or anxious. On the other hand, if you reckon that the severity of the threat is low and your ability to cope is high, then the seesaw will tip toward you, and you should feel calm and self-confident. The Stoics, like modern therapists, tried to modify both sides of this equation.

> What would a role model like Socrates, Diogenes, or Zeno do? We can also ask What would Marcus do? if faced with the same situation. In modern therapy, clients model the behavior of others and develop coping plans, which describe how they would deal with the feared situation if it actually happened. Considering what another person would do or what they would advise you to do can help you formulate better coping plans, and that will typically lead you to decatastrophize the situation and downgrade your appraisal of its severity. That means going from thinking of events as totally unbearable to picturing realistic ways you can bear them and deal with them. The more clearly formulated your coping plan is and the more confident you are about putting it into practice, the less anxious you will tend to feel.

> When their friends were struggling emotionally, Stoics sometimes wrote them letters of consolation, helping them to view events in a less catastrophic, more constructive way.

> Paconius Agrippinus, used to write similar letters to console himself whenever any hardship befell him

> Marcus tends to refer to this way of viewing events as entailing the separation of our value judgments from external events. Cognitive therapists have likewise, for many decades, taught their clients the famous quotation from Epictetus: It’s not things that upset us but our judgments about things, which became an integral part of the initial orientation (socialization) of the client to the treatment approach. This sort of technique is referred to as cognitive distancing in CBT, because it requires sensing the separation or distance between our thoughts and external reality. Beck defined it as a metacognitive process, meaning a shift to a level of awareness involving thinking about thinking.

Distancing refers to the ability to view one’s own thoughts (or beliefs) as constructions of reality rather than as reality itself.35
He recommended explaining this to clients using the analogy of colored glasses. We could look at the world through positive rose-tinted glasses or sad blue ones and just assume that what we see is how things are. However, we can also look at the glasses themselves and realize that they color our vision. Noticing how our thoughts and beliefs tinge our perception of the world is a[…]

> cognitive distancing techniques used in modern CBT, such as these:

•  Writing down your thoughts concisely when they occur and viewing them on paper
•  Writing them on a whiteboard and looking at them over there—literally from a distance
•  Prefixing them with a phrase like Right now, I notice that I am thinking…
•  Referring to them in the third person, for example, Donald is thinking…, as if you’re studying the thoughts and beliefs of someone else
•  Evaluating in a detached manner the pros and cons of holding a certain opinion
•  Using a counter or a tally to monitor with detached curiosity the frequency of certain thoughts
•  Shifting perspective and imagining a range of alternative ways of looking at the same situation so that your initial viewpoint becomes less fixed and rigid. For example, How might I feel about crashing my car if I were like Marcus Aurelius? If this happened to my daughter, how would I advise her to cope? How will I think about this, looking back on events, ten or twenty years from now?

> There are several distancing methods found in the ancient Stoic literature. For instance, you can help yourself gain cognitive distance just by speaking to (apostrophizing) your thoughts and feelings, saying something like, You are just a feeling

> not really the thing you claim to represent, as Epictetus in the Handbook advised his students to do.

> Handbook actually opens with a technique to remind ourselves that some things are up to us, or directly under our control, and other things are not. Modern Stoics sometimes call this the Dichotomy of Control or the Stoic Fork. Just recalling this distinction can help you recover a sense of indifference toward external things.

> if something is outside your control, then it’s simply irrational to demand that you should obtain or avoid it. It’s a contradiction to believe both that you must do something and also that it’s not within your power to do so. The Stoics viewed this confusion as the root cause of most emotional suffering.

> The Stoics view only their own actions as good or bad, virtuous or vicious, and therefore classify all external things as indifferent, because they’re not entirely up to us

> Marcus therefore compares our opinions to beams of sunlight shining on external objects, not unlike Beck’s analogy of looking at the world through tinted glasses. By realizing that our value judgments are projections, Marcus says, we separate them from external events. He refers to this cognitive process as the purification (katharsis) of the mind.

> As a young man, Marcus Aurelius frequently became very angry, often struggling to avoid losing his temper.

> The Stoics taught Marcus that anger is nothing but temporary madness and that its consequences are often irreparable

> They also provided him with the psychological concepts and set of tools he needed to master his own feelings of aggression

> One of them is to wait until our feelings have naturally abated and then calmly consider what someone wise would do in a similar situation.

> Marcus clearly revered Rusticus, soon came to view himself as the Stoic’s disciple, and remained devoted to him for decades, even after becoming emperor

> As Marcus said elsewhere, philosophy was his mother, the court merely his stepmother.2

> Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus, he says, pulled Arrian and Rusticus away from their books, refusing to let them be mere pen-and-ink philosophers.3 The emperors didn’t let Arrian and Rusticus write about courage while remaining safely at home, composing legal treatises while avoiding public life, or pondering the best form of administration while abstaining from participation in the government of Rome, we’re told. Instead, they were escorted from the study of Stoic philosophy to the general’s tent and to the speaker’s platform.

> The examples of men like these who went before Marcus—statesmen and military commanders inspired by Stoicism—encouraged him to believe he could be both an emperor and a philosopher.

> Marcus to be a careful and patient student of philosophy, to read attentively rather than just skimming things, and not to be swayed too easily by speakers who have a silver tongue.

> told his students repeatedly that they should not speak about philosophy lightly, like the Sophists, but rather show its fruits in their very character and actions. In typically blunt fashion he told them that sheep don’t vomit up grass to show the shepherds how much they’ve eaten but rather digest their food inwardly and produce good wool and milk outwardly.

> As we, in a sense, loves ourselves most of all, we are also most blind with regard to our own faults. The majority of us therefore struggle to attain the self-awareness required to improve our lives.
> Galen’s solution to this problem is for us to find a suitable mentor in whose wisdom and experience we can genuinely trust.

> We all know that someone is angry when their face turns red and they start yelling, but a true expert on human nature would be able to tell when someone is just on the verge of getting angry, perhaps before they even realize it themselves. We should therefore make the effort to acquire an older and wiser friend: one renowned for honesty and plain speaking, who has mastered the same passions with which we need help, who can properly identify our vices and tell us frankly where we’re going astray in life. What Galen is describing sounds somewhat like the relationship between a modern-day counselor or psychotherapist and their client. However, a better comparison would probably be with the mentoring or sponsorship provided by recovering drug or alcohol addicts to those who are in recovery and struggling with similar habits—the help of a more experienced fellow patient, as Seneca puts it

> We should ask that person if they notice any unhealthy passions in us, says Galen, assuring them that we’re not going to be offended if they speak frankly. Galen also explains that the novice is bound to feel that some of his mentor’s observations are unfair, but he must learn to listen patiently and take criticism on the chin without becoming irritated.

> There’s no point in speaking plainly to people if it doesn’t benefit them. Throughout The Meditations, Marcus makes many references to the value he places on speaking the truth, but he also consistently recognizes the importance of communicating it appropriately.

> If someone used a word incorrectly, Alexander would not overtly criticize the speaker. He never interrupted them or challenged them on the spot. Instead, the grammarian had a more artful and indirect way of steering them in the right direction. Marcus noticed that Alexander would subtly drop in the correct expression while replying or discussing some other topic. If the real goal for Stoics is wisdom, then sometimes just blurting out the truth isn’t enough. We have to put more effort into communicating with others effectively.

> Diplomacy was, of course, particularly important to Marcus

> Indeed, he even reminds himself that he should always be tactful and honest with whoever he’s speaking to, especially in the Senate

> The Stoics realized that to communicate wisely, we must phrase things appropriately

> What’s required first is a more general openness to criticism: we should give everyone we meet permission to tell us what our faults are, according to Galen, and resolve not to be angry with any of them

> Marcus imagines a wise teacher instructing someone to think of nothing he would be unwilling to say aloud, uncensored, as soon as it comes into his mind

> he’s also alluding to a very powerful therapeutic strategy. Being observed can help us develop greater self-awareness and correct our behavior, especially if we’re in the presence of someone we admire, such as a trusted mentor. Even in the absence of your own Rusticus, however, just imagining that you’re being observed by someone wise and benevolent can potentially have similar benefits, especially if you pretend that your innermost thoughts and feelings are somehow visible to them

> we should act carefully in all things—just as if we were going to answer for it to our teachers shortly thereafter.16 That’s a rather clever mind trick that turns Stoic mentoring into a kind of mindfulness practice.

> A Stoic-in-training, like the young Marcus, would have been advised always to exercise self-awareness by monitoring his own thoughts, actions, and feelings, perhaps as if his mentor, Rusticus, were continually observing him. Epictetus told his students that, just as someone who walks barefoot is cautious not to step on a nail or twist his ankle, they should be careful throughout the day not to harm their own character by lapsing into errors of moral judgment.17 In modern therapy, it’s common for clients who are making progress to wonder between sessions what their therapist might say about the thoughts they have

> Galen suggested that imitating a role model is more appropriate in our youth. Later in life, as we take more responsibility for our own character, it becomes important to follow specific philosophical principles and practice living by them. Over the years, with more experience, we should develop more self-awareness and become able to spot our own errors without needing the help of a mentor. Moreover, we gradually learn to weaken passions such as anger through disciplined practice and checking their expression at an early stage. Doing this frequently will eventually make us less prone to experiencing such feelings in the first place.

> modeling strategies

> two main categories: writing and imagining.

> Your first step is to write down the virtues exhibited by someone you respect. Listing the qualities you most admire in another person, just as Marcus does in the first book of The Meditations, is a simple and powerful exercise.

> Nothing cheers our soul, he says, like the people close to us exhibiting virtue in their lives, and for that very reason we should treasure these examples and keep the memory of them fresh. Writing things down will often make the image more vivid and memorable. Stoics considered this a healthy source of joy.

> Over a decade after Antoninus’s death, for example, Marcus was still reminding himself to remain a faithful disciple to him in all areas of life

> Antoninus who showed him that an emperor could win the respect of his subjects without bodyguards, expensive robes, precious ornaments, statues, and all other such trappings of his station in life.

> Modeling is typically followed by the mental rehearsal of behavior change: picturing yourself acting more like your role models or imagining yourself following their advice.

> When teaching people to employ Stoic practices, I’ve found it helpful to have a simple framework for daily Stoic practices. It involves a learning cycle with a beginning, middle, and end, which then repeats each day. In the morning you prepare for the day ahead; throughout the day you try to live consistently in accord with your values; and in the evening you review your progress and prepare to repeat the cycle again the next day. I’ll refer to the Stoic exercises used at the beginning and end of each day as the morning and evening meditations. Having a daily routine like this makes it much easier to be consistent in your practice.

> During your morning meditation, consider what tasks you have to complete and what challenges you

> overcome. Ask yourself, What would my role model do? and try to imagine them dealing with the same situations you’re about to face. Mentally rehearse the virtues you want to exhibit. Throughout the day, try continually to be self-aware, as if a wise mentor or teacher is observing you. We call this Stoic mindfulness today, but the Stoics meant something similar by prosoche, or paying attention to yourself. Keep an eye on how you use your mind and body, particularly the value judgments you make in different situations, and watch out for subtle feelings of anger, fear, sadness, or unhealthy desires, as well as bad habits.
> During your evening meditation, review how things actually went, perhaps going over the key events of the day two or three times in your mind’s eye. What would your imaginary mentors say? What advice might they give you about doing things differently next time? This is your opportunity to learn from experience and prepare for the morning, when you’ll plan your behavior and rehearse things again in an ongoing cycle of self-improvement. You might ask yourself, for example, What would Marcus Aurelius say about how I fared today?

> Regarding the morning meditation, Galen says that as soon as you rise from bed and begin considering each of the tasks ahead, you should ask yourself two questions:

1. What would the consequences be if you acted as a slave to your passions?
2. How would your day differ if you acted more rationally, exhibiting wisdom and self-discipline?

> He likewise tells himself on awakening that he is rising to fulfill his potential for wisdom and not just to be a puppet of bodily sensations, swayed by pleasant feelings or turned aside by discomfor

> You can ask yourself these three very simple questions:

1. What did you do badly? Did you allow yourself to be ruled by irrational fears or unhealthy desires? Did you act badly or allow yourself to indulge in irrational thoughts?
2. What did you do well? Did you make progress by acting wisely? Praise yourself and reinforce what you want to repeat.
3. What could you do differently? Did you omit any opportunities to exercise virtue or strength of character? How could you have handled things better?

> young Stoics being observed or questioned by a trusted mentor became deeply mindful of their thoughts and actions. To some extent, knowing that you are going to cross-examine yourself at the end of the day can have a similar effect.

> Following this daily routine, in a sense, helps us to do that by acting like a mentor to ourselves.

> This regimen will make you more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and actions

> Am I behaving like a child, a tyrant, a sheep, a wolf, or am I fulfilling my true potential as a rational being? For what purpose am I currently using my mind?

> The Stoics employed the Socratic method of questioning, the elenchus, which exposes contradictions in the beliefs of the person being questioned—a bit like the cross-examination of a witness in a court of law. They believed above all that the wise man is consistent in both his thoughts and actions. Foolish people, by contrast, vacillate, driven by contradictory passions, which flutter from one thing to another like butterflies.

> One of the main things it tends to highlight is any contradiction between the values we use to guide our own lives, or the things we desire, and the values we use to judge other people, or what we find praiseworthy and blameworthy. Therapists today would call this a double standard.

> his sort of Socratic questioning forms part of an approach called values clarification, which has been around since the 1970s but has recently gone through a resurgence of popularity among therapists and researchers

> •  What’s ultimately the most important thing in life to you?
> •  What do you really want your life to stand for or represent?
> •  What do you want to be remembered for after you’re dead?
> •  What sort of person do you most want to be in life?
> •  What sort of character do you want to have?
> •  What would you want written on your tombstone?

> Another useful values clarification technique for students of Stoicism involves making two short lists in side-by-side columns headed Desired and Admired:

1. Desired. The things you most desire for yourself in life
2. Admired. The qualities you find most praiseworthy and admirable in other people
These two lists are, at first, virtually never identical. Why are they different, and how would your life change if you desired for yourself the qualities you find admirable in other people?

> Once you clarify your core values, you can compare them to the Stoic cardinal virtues of wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation. People find it surprisingly helpful to set aside even a few minutes per day to reflect deeply upon their values. Indeed, values clarification has become an integral part of modern evidence-based treatments for clinical depression. Clarifying our values and trying to live more consistently in accord with them can help us gain a greater sense of direction and meaning in life, leading to greater satisfaction and fulfillment. Try brainstorming small ways in which you can do things that satisfy your core values each day.

> Remember: the fundamental goal of life for Stoics,

> the highest good, is to act consistently in accord with reason and virtue.

> There are two more key points about Stoic joy worth emphasizing:

1. The Stoics tended to view joy not as the goal of life, which is wisdom, but as a by-product of it, so they believed that trying to pursue it directly might lead us down the wrong path if it’s sought at the expense of wisdom.
2. Joy in the Stoic sense is fundamentally active rather than passive; it comes from perceiving the virtuous quality of our own deeds, the things we do, whereas bodily pleasures arise from experiences that happen to us, even if they’re a consequence of actions like eating, drinking, or having sex.

> The wise man’s sense of delight comes from one thing alone: acting consistently in accord with virtue

> Most of us find ourselves seeking hedonistic pleasures and indulging in bad habits that can seem difficult to break.

> psychologists working in the 1970s developed reliable ways of changing ordinary habits and cravings. These methods are still being applied by therapists today to issues like snacking on unhealthy foods or fingernail biting

> how you might introduce other sources of healthy positive feelings by:

1. Planning new activities that are consistent with your core values.
2. Contemplating the qualities you admire in other people.

> Practicing gratitude for the things you already have in life.

> The Stoics often reminded themselves of the paradox that unhealthy emotions such as fear and anger actually do us more harm than the things we’re upset about
